<h1> Math of Intelligence #4 - Neural Networks </h1>

This is the response to the coding challenge [Neural Networks - The Math of Intelligence #4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov_RkIJptwE).

<h3> Dependencies </h3>
This notebook uses:

* Numpy : For bulding self organising maps
* Keras : For example clustering problem

<h3> Description </h3>

This notebook initially implements SOM referencing [this](https://github.com/llSourcell/neural_networks).  
Later as an example feature vectors of dimension 2048 is reduced to 2 dimensions. The feature vectors of images (dogs and cats) are generated by extracting weights from the penultimate layer of Inception model. The notebook Image classification using keras and Inception model is uploaded as a reference.
